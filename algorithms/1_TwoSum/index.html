		<h1>1. Two Sum</h1>
		<pre>
			Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

			You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
		</pre>
		<pre>
			Example:
			Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

			Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
			return [0, 1].
